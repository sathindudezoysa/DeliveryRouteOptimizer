# Delivery Route Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to optimize the delivery route for a set of delivery points and a warehouse. It uses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the best sequential delivery path and then maps the sequence to real cities, adjusting for traffic conditions using shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra.

## Assumptions

- One vehicle is leaving from the warehouse
- The vehicle goes to the delivery point only once.
- All delivery points must be covered in a sequential manner.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delivery-route-optimization.git
